# Economy Simulation  

The Economy Simulation allows you to simulate a real-world economy. Players can change features of an economy, which will stimulate a change in other determinants. The simulation demonstrates why politicians make certain decisions, and compromises. This project was part of my A-Level coursework and I received 100%.

# External Factors

 - **Time** - Time in this game is important, players can alter the speed at which the game processes (Speed: 1% = 1/2s Ticks, 100% = 1s Ticks, 200% = 2s Ticks). This is useful in a recession if a player wants more time to fix a problem, or in a boom where they might want to speed the game up.  
 
 - **Strikes** - At certain intervals in the simulation, if a budget sector is neglected, unions will organise a strike, forcing you to invest money into that sector.
